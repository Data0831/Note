<u>1.5 [4]</u> <§1.6> Consider three different processors P1, P2, and P3 executing the same instruction set. P1 has a 3 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.5. P2 has a 2.5 GHz clock rate and a CPI of 1.0. P3 has a 4.0 GHz clock rate and has a CPI
of 2.2.

a. Which processor has the highest performance expressed in instructions per second?

b. If the processors each execute a program in 10 seconds, find the number of cycles and the number of instructions.

c. We are trying to reduce the execution time by 30% but this leads to an increase of 20% in the CPI. What clock rate should we have to get this time reduction?

***
1.6 [20] <§1.6> Consider two different implementations of the same instruction set architecture. The instructions can be divided into four classes according to their CPI (class A, B, C, and D). P1 with a clock rate of 2.5 GHz and CPIs of 1, 2, 3, and 3, and P2 with a clock rate of 3 GHz and CPIs of 2, 2, 2, and 2.

Given a program with a dynamic instruction count of 1.0E6 instructions divided into classes as follows: 10% class A, 20% class B, 50% class C, and 20% class D, which implementation is faster? 


a. What is the global CPI for each implementation?
b. Find the clock cycles required in both cases.

1.8 The Pentium 4 Prescott processor, released in 2004, had a clock rate of 3.6 GHz and voltage of 1.25 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 10 W of static power and 90 W of dynamic power.

The Core i5 Ivy Bridge, released in 2012, had a clock rate of 3.4 GHz and voltage of 0.9 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 30 W of static power and 40 W of dynamic power.

1.8.1 [5] <§1.7> For each processor find the average capacitive loads.

Ans: 
(C) = 2 x DP/(V2 x F) 
Pentium 4: C = 3.2x10<sup>-8</sup>F 
Core i5 Ivy Bridge: C = 2.9x10<sup>-8</sup>F

>[!詳解]-
>在公式 C = 2 * DP/(V^2 * F) 中，因子 2 是由於處理器中每個電容器都有兩個端點，因此需要考慮電源和地面兩端的電容，這就是為什麼需要將單側電容值乘以 2。
>
>例如，如果處理器中有多個電容器，那麼需要將它們的電容值加總起來，並且每個電容器的電容值都需要乘以 2，以考慮電源和地面兩端的影響。這樣才能得到整個處理器中的總電容負載。
>
>在處理器運作時，電容器會不斷地充放電，這會產生電流。電流的大小與電容器的電容值、電源電壓以及地面電位差有關。因此，如果忽略了電源和地面的影響，那麼計算出來的電容負載就會偏低，進而低估處理器的功耗。

1.8.2 [5] <§1.7> Find the percentage of the total dissipated power comprised by static power and the ratio of static power to dynamic power for each technology.


***
1.9 Assume for arithmetic, load/store, and branch instructions, a processor has CPIs of 1, 12, and 5, respectively. Also assume that on a single processor a program requires the execution of 2.56E9 arithmetic instructions, 1.28E9 load/store instructions, and 256 million branch instructions. Assume that each processor has a 2 GHz clock frequency.

Assume that, as the program is parallelized to run over multiple cores, the number of arithmetic and load/store instructions per processor is divided by 0.7 x p (where p is the number of processors) but the number of branch instructions per processor remains the same.

1.9.1 [5] <§1.7> Find the total execution time for this program on 1, 2, 4, and 8 processors, and show the relative speedup of the 2, 4, and 8 processor result relative to the single processor result.

1.9.2 [10] <§§1.6, 1.8> If the CPI of the arithmetic instructions was doubled, what would the impact be on the execution time of the program on 1, 2, 4, or 8
processors?
