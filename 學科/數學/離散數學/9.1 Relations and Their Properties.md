## Definition
R = {(a, b) | a∈A and b∈B}
>(a,b) is called ordered pair

### Description
- a R b = (a, b) ∈ R 、a ~~R~~ b = (a, b) ∉ R
- table, 0-1 matrix, directed graph

function:
- (a, b) => b = f (a)
- (a, f (a)) for a ∈ A.)

### Amount of relations
Q: How many relations are there from A to B?
	A: |P(A$\times$B)| = 2<sup>|AxB|</sup> 
Q: if |A| = n、 |B| = m
	A: 2<sup>nm</sup>
Q: if n = m
	A: 2<sup>nxn</sup>

### Properties
- reflexive: `(a, a) ∈ R`
	- ∀a((a, a) ∈ R)
	- Irreflexive: ∀a((a, a) ∉ R)
- symmetric: `if (b, a) ∈ R whenever (a, b) ∈ R`
	- ∀a∀b((a, b) ∈ R → (b, a) ∈ R)
	- Asymmetric: If (a, b)∈R, then (b, a)∉R
- antisymmetric: `if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R, then a = b`
	- ∀a∀b(((a, b) ∈ R ∧ (b, a) ∈ R) → (a = b))
- transitive: `if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R`
	- ∀a∀b∀c(((a, b) ∈ R ∧ (b, c) ∈ R) → (a, c) ∈ R)
- divides
	- ∀a∀b((a, b) → (b%a = 0) ∈ R)
>All is relation R on a set A

a can equal to b by page 577
## Combining Realations
- set operations (∪、∩、-)
- R1 ⊕ R2 = R1 ∪ R2 − R1 ∩ R2 = {(x, y) | x = y}
- composite S◦R
	- ∀a∀b∀c(((a, b) ∈ R ∧ (b, c) ∈ S) → (a, c) ∈ S◦R)
> S◦R is different with R◦S

### Powers
- A<sup>1</sup> = A, A<sup>n+1</sup> = A<sup>n</sup>$\times$A
- R<sup>1</sup> = R, R<sup>n+1</sup> = R<sup>n</sup>◦R
>Let A be a set、R be a relation on set A, n = 1,2,3...

Inverse relation: R<sup>-1</sup> = {(b,a)| a,b∈R}
Complementary relation: $\bar R$ = {(a,b)| a,b∉R}

## Definitions and Theorems
### DEFINITION 1 
Let A and B be sets. A binary relation from A to B is a subset of A × B
### DEFINITION 2
A relation on a set A is a relation from A to A.
### DEFINITION 3
A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if (a, a) ∈ R for every element a ∈ A.
### DEFINITION 4
A relation R on a set A is called symmetric if (b, a) ∈ R whenever (a, b) ∈ R, for all a, b ∈ A.  A relation R on a set A such that for all a, b ∈ A, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R, then a = b  is called antisymmetric.
### DEFINITION 5
A relation R on a set A is called transitive if whenever (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R,  
then (a, c) ∈ R, for all a, b, c ∈ A
### DEFINITION 6
Let R be a relation from a set A to a set B and S a relation from B to a set C. The composite  
of R and S is the relation consisting of ordered pairs (a, c), where a ∈ A, c ∈ C, and for  
which there exists an element b ∈ B such that (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ S. We denote the  
composite of R and S by S◦R
### DEFINITION 7
Let R be a relation on the set A. The powers R<sup>n</sup>, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , are defined recursively by  
R<sup>1</sup> = R and R<sup>n+1</sup> = R<sup>n</sup> ◦ R
### THEOREM 1 
The relation R on a set A is transitive if and only if R<sup>n</sup> ⊆ R for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

## 英文語法
- binary relation from A to B: subsets of A$\times$B
- a related to b by R: (a, b)
- relation on a set A: A<sup>2</sup>
- Relation with Itself: A<sup>2</sup>
- a divides b: a除以b = b除a (沒有餘數)
